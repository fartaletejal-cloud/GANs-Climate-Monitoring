# GAN Based Enhanced Climate Change Monitoring System

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic climate data for enhancing climate change monitoring.

## Features
- Climate dataset preprocessing
- GAN model for synthetic data generation
- Visualization of real vs generated climate data

## Tools Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open Climate_GAN.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells
